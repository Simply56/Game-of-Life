# Game of Life
This is a modified version of the Game of Life.
It feautes a custom parallel hash map and a custom thread pool.

### Why?
In the first semester of college, we were tasked with implementing the logic portion for a modified game of life.
It was written in Python and rendered using tkinter; that rendered was given to us and it was painfully slow.

Since then, I have wondered how much faster I can make it.
